        "* Link to your Git and LinkedIn profile;\n",

        "The first two parts (Data Extraction and Data Querying) are straightforward and each one is worth 25% of the overall score. The last part , worth 50% of the overall score, is more open-ended and meant to stretch your data science knowledge. Each section has one extra challenge. They are not mandatory nor counted in the general score, but if you have time, they are the chance to impress us with your extraordinary skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Guidelines\n",
        "* We expect that the test should take around 6 hours to do. However, we strongly advise you to carefully read this assignment, think about approaches and try to understand the data before diving into the questions. You are free to spend as much time on it as you want, within the timeframe given by our recruiter.\n",
        "* **You can complete this assignment working on this Google Colab, or if you prefer you can use download it and use it as standalone jupyter notebook and send them back to us together with the relevant files.**\n",
